# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP

This is my **major Data Science project** focused on detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.

---

## 📌 Objective

Build a machine learning model to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** based on textual content.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle  
- **Files**: `Fake.csv` and `True.csv`  
- **Total Records**: ~45,000  
- **Columns**: `title`, `text`, `subject`, `date`, `label` (0 = Fake, 1 = Real)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, Numpy  
- NLTK, Scikit-learn  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Project Workflow

- Data Loading & Merging  
- Text Preprocessing  
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF  
- Model Training & Evaluation  
- Visualizations (WordCloud, Confusion Matrix)  
- Deployment with Flask *(optional)*

---

## 📊 Model Performance

*(To be added later)*

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

*(To be added once folders are created)*

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add more models like **BERT** or **LSTM**  
- Deploy with **Flask** or **Streamlit**
